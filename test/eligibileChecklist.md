SR&ED Software Eligibility Checklist
============================================


In order for your project to be eligible for SR&ED the development activities you performed need to meet very specific eligibility criteria.


We need to focus on those development activities that involved *technological problems* where the *solution could not be found* by following *routine* approaches,
such as the the application of known,
conventional or standard programming solutions or techniques.

![Note]Even if you had no prior experience in a particular area &mdash; it was new to us &mdash; but you applied appropriate *due diligence* and found a ready-made solution, then it would not be eligible, even if you had a steep learning curve.




A good verification that your problem could not be solved through known techniques is to prove that you searched through relevant forums online,
or contacted the software application's technical support and they couldn't provide you with a solution.

![NOTE] An email from Microsoft stating *Our software does not support the type of activity you are trying to accomplish* is excellent evidence that your activity is not routine, or, if searching through forums, you posts from other developers with similar issues for which they reported no solution could be found.

SR&ED eligible solutions to these types of technological problems can include analysis,
simulation,
prototyping,
experimentation,
testing,
and the like,
to overcome uncertainties.
They can also involve evaluating alternative approaches
&mdash;
method A v. method B v. method C.

Determining SR&ED Eligible Activities
----------------------------------------------------

Below are some questions that can help you determine what activities in your development process could be SR&ED eligible.

1. Did the project involve developing completely new theoretical algorithms or methods?
Did you stretch the *technological* envelope?
Were you attempting to achieve one or more performance specifications that were beyond your existing capabilities:
faster response time,
greater throughput,
more concurrent users,
or similar?

1. Were you seeking to achieve advancements at a *technological* level
&mdash;
databases,
interfaces,
source code,
algorithms,
operating systems,
or similar
&mdash;
and not on a functional level,
as in,
the tasks the software performed?

Did you have to overcome *constraints* or limitations:

1. Limited memory or CPU cache, requiring a constrained *footprint* for the code

1. Limited computing resources, for example, code had to run on a low-powered CPU

1. Limited physical size or form-factor that constrained your options

1. Response time, for example, the end-to-end computing time had to meet real-time targets

1. Concurrency, for example, system had to work for 10,000 concurrent users;

1. Scalability, for example, failed at 20 messages/second but needed to support 2000/sec

1. Stability and reliability requirements, for example, 99.99% uptime

1. Compatibility with legacy software or hardware

1. Interoperability under different operating systems, for example, Windows, Linux, or another.

1. Did you have to overcome *system-level uncertainties*,for example, challenges caused by attempting to make two or more independent modules function together in some novel way?

1. Did the creation of a new graphical user interface (GUI) pose any *unusual* technological or human-factors challenges, for example, you needed to have an interface that would improve operator speed by a factor of two?

![Note]Developing a new or improved GUI is usually *not* eligible for SR&ED, regardless of complexity.

Describing the SR&ED Process
------------------------------------

Once we identify the technological problems that you had to solve,
we need to describe the activities you performed in order to attempt to solve those problems,
even if they were unsuccessful.

Describing the unsuccessful attempts is critical to prove that the problems you encountered could not be solved through known,
conventional,
or standard programming solutions or techniques.
We are not only interested in the solution that finally fixed the problem,
but the failures that led you to discover a working solution.

During the development did you perform any of the below activities.
If so,
these are the activities we need to describe in detail.

Not including routine feature extensions,
normal debugging,
or typical quality control,
did you perform any of the following activities:

1.  Research into alternative solutions or approaches

1. Analysis, simulation, experimentation or prototyping

1. Development and testing of prototype software modules

1. Incremental system integration and testing

1. Testing on one platform before porting to the final target platform

1. Mock-ups of limited-sized systems or networks

1. Stress tests to simulate loads on the network

1. Systematic experimental probing of an inadequately specified interface

1. Field trials of *alpha* versions of the software, for example, pre-release versions.

As a result of these activities,
did the software undergo iterative design changes,
followed by further analysis or experimentation until all the obstacles were resolved (or the project was abandoned?

Documenting the SR&ED Process
-----------------------------------------


Above and beyond the project report that we will produce you need to be able to prove that these activities were performed during the fiscal year.
Documentation can include notes,
memos,
emails,
code revisions,
test results,
time sheets,
and things like this.
